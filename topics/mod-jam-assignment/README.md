# *The Swamp of Eden*

A game about catching flies. And maybe also not about flies.

# Title and instructions screen
*The Swamp of Eden* starts with a frog covering the screen, whose eyes follow the mouse as if it was a fly!

# Ending
(SPOILERS AHEAD!) *The Swamp of Eden* has two endings:
- The frog will either starve after having eaten all the flies (the swamp is empty! oh no! the paradigm is broken!)
or
- The frog will be swarmed by the flies after having let them reproduce (the flies have taken over the swamp! God- sorry, the frog* is dead!)

# Scoring system
Time is of the essence... The scoring system in The Swamp of Eden is time-based, as it counts how long the player is able to maintain the fragile equilibrium of the swamp's ecosystem.

# New kinds of fly movement
The flies follow a sine wave pattern, with varying vertical shifts within an area reachable by the frog's tongue (sorry flies, I make the rules...)

# New visual effects
The frog’s eyes follow the mouse in the main menu, effectively acting as a surrogate for a fly. The frog's eyes in the game instead follow the closest fly to itself. Gotta keep an eye on those flies!

# Additional features
The Swamp of Eden benefits from two additional features:
- A new control system: the player can move the frog with the left and right arrows, and trigger the tongue with the spacebar.
- A feedback loop system: the more flies reproduce, the more flies there are, entering a feedback loop that effectively gradually compounds and causes the game to end.
