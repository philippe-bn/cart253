**Notes**

1. The flies fly faster and faster every time you catch one (how often does it reset? does it reset immediately if the fly is caught halfway across the screen? how much does it increase everytime? how does the game know when to end - or too fast to be caught?)
2. The frog goes on the side every 5 points (how does this change the mechanic of catching the fly? what does it even mean? what's the point? why 5 points specifically?)
3. The frog jumps every time it catches a fly (does it reset back to its position after the jump? does it progressively advance on the screen? what happens when it reaches the top of the screen?)
4. The frog gets bigger with every fly it eats (how much bigger does it get everytime? how big is too big? how does this change the game's mechanics?)
5. The frog gets frustrated if it doesn't catch the flies (how does "frustrated" visually look like? does it change colour? does it start having less accuracy? does its vision change and so the overall visibility of the player change?)
6. The frog starves if it doesn't catch the flies (how does this affect the frog? does it lose energy? does the tongue move slower? does the frog die at some point? after how many flies does it reach this state?)
7. The flies duplicate every time one is missed until they cover the whole screen and the player loses (how many flies does it take to cover the whole screen? where do the other flies come from? what do they want?)
8. The flies' population varies over time depending on their health which is accumulated through time (how is the fly population quantity available to the player? how is their health visualized? how is the passage of time visualized?)
9. The flies can eat other decomposed flies to gain health (how does the player know the fly ate the decomposed one? is it a message written on the screen? how does the fly's path intersect with the one lying dead?)
10. The flies that die sometimes fall somewhere other than the frog's mouth (how do we determine which flies should fall somewhere else? what does it mean about the frog when it doesn't retrieve the fly all the way to its mouth?)
11. The frog sometimes drops the fly halfway (*what does it mean about the frog when it doesn't retrieve the fly all the way to its mouth?*)
12. The frog sometimes is not hungry anymore if it eats too fast (how is this made obvious to the player? does this affect the frog's health? how much time has to pass for the frog's hunger to reset?)
13. The frog throws up if it eats too fast (what does this mean for the flies? how is this visualized? how much time has to pass for the frog's hunger to reset?)
14. The flies taunt the frog if they survive (how is this visualized? how does the frog know when to stop?)
15. The flies can escape through the top of the screen too (how does the fly's position reset if it escapes through the top? should the flies appear from any side?)
16. The flies make a sound when they are caught (are they happy? are they sad? do they scream in anguish? is it a realistic sound? a funny sound?)
17. The frog makes a sound when it eats (is it a realistic sound? a funny sound?)
18. The flies can reproduce if they hit each other (how do their paths intersect? what are their flight patterns? how many flies are born when they reproduce?)
19. The frog can reproduce if it eats enough flies (what is "enough" flies? how does it reproduce visually? does the baby frog grow?)
20. The frog sometimes has to hide from a bird of prey (how often does the bird pass? how does the bird look? is it always appearing from the top? how do the flies react? how does the frog hide?)
21. The frog is sometimes hunted by humans for meat (how often does this happen? can the frog hide? is it game over immediately? is there an epilogue with a scene of humans eating the frog?)
22. The frog is French (does the frog talk? does it talk in french? does it have a french accent? does the game have french landmarks in its landscape?)
