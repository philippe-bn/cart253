## Description

> *Meet Me* is an interactive self-portrait that invites the user into a meeting with my avatar.

> The user can move the mouse from left to right for my avatar to wave, and from top to bottom to discover aspects of my personality as well as my interests. Clicking will make my avatar laugh, while hovering over my avatar's eyes forces him to close them.

> This self-portrait intends to leave a friendly impression on the viewer!
