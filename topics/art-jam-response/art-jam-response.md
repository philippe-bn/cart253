***Self portrait of Yelena Arakelian* by Yelena Arakelian**
I found the cookie eating sound funny! I thought it was interesting that the artist went with a humoristic approach to their self-portrait. Another example of this for me was the unrealistic aspect of the mouth opening extremely wide as I moved my mouse inwards from the edges of the canvas towards it. I found the sound effects on the bee quite compelling: I was impressed that the artist had put in a dynamic that made it so that the sound of the bee was louder the closer it got to the cookie. I noticed that the artist had mentioned that the background changes over time, but I could not see this in their piece and I believe this is due to my colorblindness. I was surprised that with very little detail the artist could convey a bee - with two circles and two colours, the image is instantly recognizable.

***Me, I and Myself* by Yvonne Arriola Lerin**
I found two elements particularly striking from the get go. First, the flight pattern of the bee on the screen: I was not able to determine simply visually what this pattern was and I found that quite compelling. I was also struck by the dynamic of the cookie making the mouths of the bee and the character change sizes as I moved it around the canvas. I found that this was executed particularly well. I was a bit surprised that the bee in the upper left corner was static. The static quality of this bee stuck out due to its stark contrast with the hyperactive motion of its counterpart. I was also curious to understand the artist's motive behind portraying themselves as what seems to me to be another bug, with its antennas and odd shape. Overall, the colours and style of this self-portrait stood out.

***Nou Noune's Art Jam* by Am√©lie Barrette**
I was surprised by the personal quality of this self-portrait; from the text displayed on the screen introducing themselves, to the mouse cursor being a picture of their cat, and the different personal elements embedded in this experience, this piece felt intimate and honest. I found that the inclusion of an audio component when pressing down on the mouth was a surprising element, and one that maybe did not feel intuitive for me, but ultimately was revealing of the artist's ability to make audacious connections - such as putting a sung piece on the mouth of their character, so that when the user "allows" them to "open" their mouth, they sing a song from *The Sims*. I thought that this gave the user information about the artist in a unique way. I was also compelled by the combination of elements drawn from geometric shapes and elements brought in from elsewhere. This clash of textures and aesthetic qualities was particularly striking to me.
